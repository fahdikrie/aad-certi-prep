Hello, my name is Fahdii, i'm from Indonesia... and this is my take for the exam #1 exit interview

For the first question,
1. What project have you worked about?

This is basically a very simple to-do app with CREATE, READ, and DELETE functionality, with its main goal is to help
the user to track their tasks.

If we look further into the app, there are four screens available inside it, which are:
- Task List Screen
- Create Task Screen
- Detail Task Screen, and
- Settings Screen

In detail screen, the user could delete their task. But for your information, this current iteration of the app
does not include Update Task functionality.

Another thing i'd like to mention about this app is that there is a notification function as a reminder. Which,
in my opinion is a very cool and fundamental thing to have in a Task Journaling App.

Lastly, the technologies used in this app are:
- Kotlin as the programming language
- Rec
- LiveData
- ViewModel
- Paging
- NotificationWorker, and
- Room & Room Prepopulate database

Onto the next question,
2. Which part is hardest?

For me, I think the hardest part is to implement

3. What components have been used to show a list of tasks?


4. How does notification reminder work?


5. Why do we need a Custom View?
